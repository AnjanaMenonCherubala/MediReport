MediReport

Everyone cannot read or understand their medical reports (lipid profile, CBC report, LFT, RFT, etc.). They have to take a day off from work and go to a doctor for getting a sense of their annual health reports. Our solution will save them time and money of a doctor's visit by making an informed decision about their health using their medical reports.

Abstract
1. Scan report/Upload softcopy of the report to our system. 
2. Using OCR and/or NLP, we parse the report and use public data sets such as DBpedia's, etc., to get the definitions if the medical terms.
3. We use ML to find if any correlations are present between fields and if any medical diagnosis can be made out of it.
4. We also display in our app, meaning of each field in the medical report. If required, we also display ways through which a person may be able to bring the field's value within the normal range.
