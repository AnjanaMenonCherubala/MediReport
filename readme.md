Idea #1 - 

Project Title: Medical report suggestion

Goal of the project: To help the common man understand their medical reports without going to a doctor

Project idea description:
Need: Everyone cannot read or understand their medical reports (lipid profile, CBC report, LFT, RFT, etc.). They have to take a day off from work and go to a doctor for getting a sense of their annual health reports. Our solution will save them time and money of a doctor's visit by making an informed decision about their health using their medical reports.

Process: 
1. Scan report/Upload softcopy of the report to our system. 
2. Using OCR and/or NLP, we parse the report and use public data sets such as DBpedia's, etc., to get the definitions if the medical terms.
3. We use ML to find if any correlations are present between fields and if any medical diagnosis can be made out of it.
4. We also display in our app, meaning of each field in the medical report. If required, we also display ways through which a person may be able to bring the field's value within the normal range.

Technology stack: OCR, NLP, Linked Open Data/Semantic Graph, etc.

Project Title: Plan Meal 

Goal of the project: Help the common man plan and improve their meal preparation, and eat healthier

Project idea description:
Need:  Minimize the stress to find ingredients in a dish and help in finding those ingredients nearby. 

Process: 
Upload an image of the dish
A recipe will be suggested along with ingredients using CNN.
We use machine learning algorithms to find the nearest grocery stores where you purchase the ingredients.
Each ingredient will be displayed with cheaper options.
A customer can personalize their meal with below options
    a) make it more healthy
    b) reduce the cost of the overall meal
  6. Analyze the eating habits over a course of time and suggest dietary changes.

Technology stack: OCR, NLP, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

Project Title: Product Sale Booster in the e-commerce marketplace

Goal of the project: The primary purpose of this product is to help sellers on e-commerce marketplace(s) in identifying the pain-points and suggest improvements to their products. This would help improve their sales and step up their ranking in the marketplace and profitable.

Project idea description:
Need: Currently, small vendors in the marketplace do not have a system to identify what they can do better in order to increase the sales of their products. This can happen due to a plethora of factors. Our aim is to do a detailed analysis of the product vs the best-selling product for the particular product type/category and suggest where their products are lacking in comparison to the best-seller. This will hopefully help smaller businesses and sellers to improve their products over a course of time and help level the marketplace by preventing the monopoly of one particular seller/brand/vendor. 

Process: 
1. Vectorize product details from the product description, titles, reviews and images.
2. Repeat the above step for the best selling product in that category.
3. Identify missing features using ML and NLP.
4. Provide relevant suggestions to improve product features.

Technology stack:  NLP, Watson ML, OCR
